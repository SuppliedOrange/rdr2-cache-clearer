# rdr2-cache-clearer
A tiny solution to a problem I face

## What?
Lately I've been facing terrible stutters in red dead redemption 2. The internet didn't really help me resolve it except for one answer in particular. To delete all the pipeline cache files in `Documents/Rockstar Games/RDR2 folder/Settings/`. The game did have a small but unsatisfactory performance boost after that. However, the files kept coming back. I made this script and set it to launch alongside RDR2 so that it continuously clears the pipline cache.

## Can I use this?
You can and it might even work for you. But I built this solely for myself. I've only put this here so that people looking for a solution can come here to try this out and I can keep coming back to re-install the executable

## It doesn't work
Well, that's a bummer. This is a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRedDead/comments/xf2klu/low_fps_in_rdr2_suddenly_for_no_reason/) that might help. Do not delete `settings.xml`, the user who mentioned that is wrong. Other than this, I haven't a clue. My game doesn't run very well either. I don't care enough to keep looking for solutions now, but let me know if you find any!
